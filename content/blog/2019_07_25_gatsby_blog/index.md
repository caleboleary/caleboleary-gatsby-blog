So I've decided to start a little blog in case I end up wanting to share my thoughts! I've spun this one up pretty quickly with the help of [this handy Gatsby starter blog](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-blog).

I hope to be able to use this to share my thoughts on coding, reading, writing, and anything else I like to do!

In the spirit of starting off strong, I'll share something from each of those domains that I've done/discovered recently:

- **_Coding_**: I recently attended [KCDC](https://www.kcdc.info/) (Kansas City Developer Conference) for the first time and quite enjoyed the talks. My favorites were a talk on Augmented Reality with React Native by [Alex Hinson](https://twitter.com/amhinson) and a talk on Docker by [Chris Klug](https://twitter.com/ZeroKoll).

- **_Reading_**: On my honeymoon last month, I read 2 books by [Dan Ariely](https://www.amazon.com/Dan-Ariely/e/B001J93B34) in their entirety, they were both about irrational human behavior, and incredibly interesting. I'd recommend them to anyone interested in psychology.

- **_Writing_**: I've been rewriting my first draft of a fantasy novel from first person to third person. I feel like it will give me an easier time getting into other characters head (right now, many of the secondary characters feel incredibly flat to me).
